Local infrastructure for development and testing.

## Repository Lineage and Integrity

This repository is derived from an **upstream, tagged origin repository**.

- The upstream repository is referenced by tag.
- This repository is **not bit-identical** to the upstream tag.
- The Git commit hash is therefore **different by design**.

All deviations from the upstream tag are intentional, explicit, and required
to support the local infrastructure, verification, and CI workflows defined
in this repository.

The upstream tag remains the historical reference.
This repository represents a **derived execution environment**, not a fork
claiming upstream equivalence.

Consumers MUST NOT assume hash equality with the upstream tag.
Only functional equivalence is expected where explicitly documented.
